# Web Reporter

[`server.js`](./server.js) is a modified version of the COC reporter that can handle
CORS requests. [`client.js`](./client.js) is an example of calling this function using
the fetch api.

These two bits of code will allow you to embed the reporting tool within a web app dynamically
or via a form element.
